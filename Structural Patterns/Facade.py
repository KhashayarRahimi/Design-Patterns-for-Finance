"""

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
This pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides a simpler interface to the client, making the system easier to use.

*** Purpose ***
The primary purpose of the Facade Pattern is to simplify interactions with a complex system.
By creating a facade, you can provide a higher-level interface that makes the system easier to use without exposing the underlying complexity.

*** Intuition ***
Imagine you have a financial system with multiple modules for trading, reporting, and market data analysis.
Each module has its own complex interface. The Facade Pattern can be used to create a single simplified interface that allows clients to interact with these modules more easily.

*** Structure ***
Facade: Provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem.
Subsystem Classes: Classes that implement the complex functionality.

*** Example: Financial Trading System ***
Let's consider a financial trading system with subsystems for order management, risk management, and market data analysis.

"""

#=========================================== Subsystem Classes ===========================================

# First, define the complex subsystem classes

class OrderManager:
    def place_order(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, order_type: str) -> None:
        print(f"Placing {order_type} order for {quantity} shares of {symbol}")

class RiskManager:
    def assess_risk(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:
        # Simplified risk assessment logic
        print(f"Assessing risk for {quantity} shares of {symbol}")
        return True

class MarketDataAnalyzer:
    def get_market_data(self, symbol: str) -> dict:
        # Simplified market data retrieval logic
        print(f"Retrieving market data for {symbol}")
        return {'price': 100, 'volume': 1000}

#=========================================== Facade ===========================================

# Next, create the facade that provides a simplified interface to these subsystems

class TradingFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.order_manager = OrderManager()
        self.risk_manager = RiskManager()
        self.market_data_analyzer = MarketDataAnalyzer()

    def place_trade(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, order_type: str) -> None:
        # Retrieve market data
        market_data = self.market_data_analyzer.get_market_data(symbol)
        print(f"Market Data: {market_data}")

        # Assess risk
        if self.risk_manager.assess_risk(symbol, quantity):
            # Place order
            self.order_manager.place_order(symbol, quantity, order_type)
            print("Trade placed successfully")
        else:
            print("Trade not placed due to high risk")

#=========================================== Client Code ===========================================

# Finally, use the facade in the client code to interact with the financial trading system

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a trading facade
    trading_facade = TradingFacade()

    # Place a trade using the facade
    trading_facade.place_trade("AAPL", 10, "buy")

#=========================================== How It Works ===========================================

"""
*** Subsystem Classes ***
OrderManager, RiskManager, and MarketDataAnalyzer are the complex subsystem classes that provide various functionalities.

*** Facade ***
TradingFacade is the facade that provides a simplified interface to these subsystems. It interacts with the subsystems to perform tasks like placing trades.

*** Client Code ***
The client code interacts with the TradingFacade instead of the complex subsystem classes directly, making it easier to place trades.
